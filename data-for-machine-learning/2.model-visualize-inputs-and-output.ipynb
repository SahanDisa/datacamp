    "## Demo 4.2 : Datasets in Python\n",
    "In the previous exercise we loaded some data and fit a model to it. Several aspects of this were simplified - particularly that the data was hard-coded into our python script, and we didn't spend any time really looking at the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will load data from file, filter it, and graph it. Doing so is a very important first step in order to build proper models, or to understand their limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "As normal, in the examples below, there is no need to edit any code. Try to read it, understand it, then press the run button to run it. As always, it is vitally important that these code blocks are run in the correct order, and nothing is missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loading data with Pandas\n",
    "There are large variety of libraries that help you work with data. In Python, one of the most common is Pandas. We used pandas briefly in the previous exercise. Pandas can open data saved as text files and store them in an organised table called a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's open some text data that is stored on disk. Our data is saved in a file called doggy-boot-harness.csv"
