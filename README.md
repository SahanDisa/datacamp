### Zen of python

 * Beautiful is better than ugly.
 * Explicit is better than implicit.
 * Simple is better than complex.
 * Complex is better than complicated.
 * Flat is better than nested.
 * Sparse is better than dense.
 * Readability counts.
 * Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
 * Although practicality beats purity.
 * Errors should never pass silently.
 * Unless explicitly silenced.
 * In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
 * There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.
 * Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
 * Now is better than never.
 * Although never is often better than right now
 * If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
 * If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
 * Namespaces are one honking great idea—let's do more of those!
